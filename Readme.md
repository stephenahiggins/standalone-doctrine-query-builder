# Standalone Doctrine Query Builder
A standalone implementation of the Doctrine Query Builder. Removes the dependency on having a Doctrine DB connection. This is useful for building queries for other DB connections, or using PDO to execute the query.
All credit goes to the original Doctrine team. 

**Note:** This is a work in progress and is not ready for production use.
